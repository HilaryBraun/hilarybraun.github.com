          <h1>Every Love Is Valid</h1>
           <p>
             Each student in my Graphic Design class was asked to pick a local organization that worked for a cause we believed in and create a series of posters promoting their. I chose MassEquality, a group who works to protect the rights of the LGBT community in Massachusetts. Though gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts, the struggle for equality is still being fought. With this poster series I decided to target those who don't believe gay marriage is right or traditional instead of those who already support the cause.

		    20.5"x14.75"

			I illustrated the frames and portraits. The posters were designed in Adobe Illustrator CS5 and printed on matte paper.

          <h1>Egon Schiele Booklet</h1>
           <p>
             A booklet about the life, career and legacy of artist Egon Schiele. The typography and layout reflect the distinctive work that Schiele produced in his short career as a painter. 

			I wrote the content and hand wrote the pull quotes based on Schieleâ€™s writing and materials.

			The book was created in Adobe InDesign CS5; the content was printed on Hammermill cream paper, the cover on watercolor paper; bound using signature style pamphlet stitch.

          <h1>The Glorious Light of Truth</h1>
           <p>
             For this project, our class was asked to choose a letter from the collection of historical correspondance, Letters of a Nation, as well as a text of our own choice, and design a typographic book that gives context to the letter. I chose the letter Frederick Douglass wrote to his former master Thomas Auld titled To My Old Master.  While researching the life of Frederick Douglass I was struck by the lengths he went through to become educated, an especially difficult task for slaves. For my corresponding text I chose two pieces that highlighted the power of knowledge. The first was Chapter 7 from his book Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave which details the hardships he went through to become literate. In this text he mentions Dialogue Between a Master and Slave from the schoolbook The Columbian Orator, which inspired him to escape slavery.

			 I wanted the book's design to reflect that slaves were not allowed to receive an education, and if they did they had to keep it a secret. I learned how to bind a book so that it's spine could be removed and placed on the opposite end revealing the "hidden" text, the text about education. The symbol used throughout the book is the monkey wrench, a popular quilting pattern used on the Freedom Trail. 

			 The book was designed in Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator, it is 4"x6.75"; printed on Mohawk Super Smooth paper. The endpapers are my own design of the monkey wrench symbol.

          <h1>Onomatopoeia</h1>
           <p>
              This was a two-part project in which I took a 17-second clip of of Leopold Stokowski & the Philadelphia Orchestra's "A Night on Bald Mountain" and expressed it typographically through print and through video. Both pieces were designed to visualize musical structures like pitch, rhythm, tempo, and volume, as well as the spirit of the song. 

			  The print was designed in Adobe Illustrator; it's dimensions are 33.5"x6"; printed on matte paper. This video was my first experience using Adobe AfterEffects.

          <h1>Sally's T-Shirt</h1>
           <p>
              This is a project that seeks to educate middle school children about the environmental and social impact of cotton production. The project was done in two parts: a pamphlet and a video.

			  I wrote and illustrated all of the content. Each page is 8"x5"; bound using a single signature pamphlet stitch; designed in Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator. I made a stop-motion animation using cut outs that I hand illustrated, and then translated into Adobe Illustrator. The video was edited in iMovie.

          <h1>Travel Poster and Schedule</h1>
           <p>
              While designing a travel poster for Greece, I was inspired by the images of all the unique local cuisine. Looking to attract travelers seeking an experience beyond tourist attractions, I created a poster that invites the viewer to make their experience a true adventure. The second part of this project was to take an existing train schedule and make a pocket-sized version which corresponds with our travel poster. 

			  I wrote the additional text, created all additional maps and imagery and based Attica Railways on one of the first railway systems in Greece.

			  The poster is 16.5"x 25.5", the travel schedule is 2.75"x 4.25"; both are designed using Adobe Illustrator CS5 and Adobe InDesign CS5; both are printed on matte paper; the travel schedule is double-sided and folds 3 times into an accordion format.

          <h1>How to Spike a Volleyball</h1>
           <p>
              This is an instructional poster on how to spike a volleyball. It was a group project in which I collaborated with both a volleyball expert and a volleyball novice in order to find the best solution for an everyday person looking to learn about this skill.

			This poster was designed in Adobe Illustrator CS5; it's dimensions are 18.5"x 33"; it's printed on matte paper.
